## Introduction
This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a PHP server, configure the database, and run the necessary PHP scripts (`create_db.php`, `upload.php`, and `view.php`) to upload and view data.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- PHP (version 7.0 or higher)
- MySQL or MariaDB
- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

## Installation Steps

1. **Download the Project Files**
   Download the project files and ensure you have the following PHP scripts:
   - `create_db.php`
   - `upload.php`
   - `view.php`

2. **Place Files in the Web Server Directory**
   Move the downloaded PHP files to your web server's root directory. For example, in Apache, this is typically `/var/www/html`.

3. **Edit Database Configuration**
   Open each PHP file (`create_db.php`, `upload.php`, `view.php`) and enter your database details:
   - Database name
   - Server name
   - Username
   - Password

   Example:
   ```php
   // Database configuration
   $servername = "your_server_name";
   $username = "your_username";
   $password = "your_password";
   $dbname = "your_database_name";


# Deploying to a VPS

## Upload Files to VPS

Use an FTP client or SCP to upload the PHP files (`create_db.php`, `upload.php`, `view.php`) to your VPS's web server directory (e.g., `/var/www/html`).

## Configure Web Server

Ensure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) is configured to serve the PHP files. Restart the web server if necessary.

## Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to your VPS's IP address or domain name, followed by the PHP script name (e.g., `http://your_vps_ip/upload.php`).

That's it! You have successfully set up a PHP server, configured your database, and run the necessary scripts to upload and view data.
